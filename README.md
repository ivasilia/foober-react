# foober

A fun car sharing React app.

Spring backend provided (ecar-api repository), hosted at https://foober-java.herokuapp.com/

The app functionality is represented by three main entitites: Driver, Passenger and Route. Once logged in as a Driver or a Passenger, the user can respectively create a Route or select and join an active one.

By creating a Route you are offered a sample Austrian towns selection. The distances are served by Google Maps Distance Matrix. The fuel price is figured out with the help of creativecommons.tankerkoenig.de API.

Sample driver username: Olivia, password: olivia
